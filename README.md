# ng-ai-hack

A starter project for building apps with Angular and Azure Cognitive Services (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning products).
Built by [Laurie Atkinson](https://twitter.com/JoyfulCoder) and [Brian Clark](https://twitter.com/_clarkio)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Getting Started

### Running Locally

1.  Open your favorite terminal/command prompt and run `git clone git@github.com:clarkio/ng-ai-hack.git`
2.  Register for the Azure Cognitive Services you plan to use
3.  Retrieve the API key provided for each service
4.  Update the `environment.ts` file by adding your key values in the `apiKeys` array
5.  Rename the `environment.ts` file to `environment.ts`
6.  Go back to your terminal/command prompt and change to the directory of where you cloned this project. Example `cd ng-ai-hack`
7.  Run `npm i`
8.  Run `npm i -g @angular/cli`
9.  Run `ng serve`
10. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

### Stackblitz

1.  Register for the Azure Cognitive Services you plan to use
2.  Retrieve the API key provided for each service
3.  Go to [this Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/clarkio/ng-ai-hack)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
